To investigate the efficacy of 6 weeks of daily low-dose oral prednisolone in improving pain , mobility , and systemic low-grade inflammation in the short term and whether the effect would be sustained at 12 weeks in older adults with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . A total of 125 patients with primary knee OA were randomized 1:1 ; 63 received 7.5 mg/day of prednisolone and 62 received placebo for 6 weeks. Outcome measures included pain reduction and improvement in function scores and systemic inflammation markers . Pain was assessed using the visual analog pain scale ( 0-100 mm ) . Secondary outcome measures included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores , patient global assessment ( PGA ) of the severity of knee OA , and 6-min walk distance ( 6MWD ) . Serum levels of interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - , and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) were measured .	There was a clinically relevant reduction in the intervention group compared to the placebo group for knee pain , physical function , PGA , and 6MWD at 6 weeks . The mean difference between treatment arms ( 95 % CI ) was 10.9 ( 4.8-18 .0 ) , p < 0.001 ; 9.5 ( 3.7-15 .4 ) , p < 0.05 ; 15.7 ( 5.3-26 .1 ) , p < 0.001 ; and 86.9 ( 29.8-144 .1 ) , p < 0.05 , respectively . Further , there was a clinically relevant reduction in the serum levels of IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF - , and hsCRP at 6 weeks in the intervention group when compared to the placebo group . These differences remained significant at 12 weeks . Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International responder rate was 65 % in the intervention group and 34 % in the placebo group ( p < 0.05 ) . 	Low-dose oral prednisolone had both a short-term and a longer sustained effect resulting in less knee pain , better physical function , and attenuation of systemic inflammation in older patients with knee OA ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01619163 ) .
